    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this exercise you are going to analyze the daily distance, i.e., distance covered by a vehicle in one day, of our vehicle. The daily distance of a vehicle is an established characteristic value due to its simplicity and availability. It gathers various information such as the level and regularity of utilization and therefore allows first conclusions with regard to the vehicleâ€™s movement patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "First of all we need to import all necessary packages and modules:\n",
    "* pandas (pandas dataframes)\n",
    "* numpy (numpy arrays as well as various mathematical methods)\n",
    "* matplotlib.pyplot (plotting)\n",
    "* register_matplotlib_converters (datetime converter for a matplotlib plotting method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice:<br/> \n",
    "In order to use datetime objects in plots a datetime converter is necessary. Currently the datetime converter is registered implicitly by pandas on import. However, Future versions of pandas will require you to explicitly register matplotlib converters. This is why we import and register the datetime converter manually."
